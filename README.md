# Population_Guinea_2014

# ETL_population_guinea
This code reads population data for Guinea from an Excel file and shapefile data for Guinea from a shapefile. It performs some data cleaning and manipulation, including reprojecting the shapefile to a projected coordinate system and calculating population density. It then creates a choropleth map of population density in Guinea and another choropleth map of population by prefecture, with prefecture names as labels. Finally, it sends the data to a PostgreSQL database.
